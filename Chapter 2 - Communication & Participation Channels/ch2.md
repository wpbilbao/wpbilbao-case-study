# WordPress Bilbao - Case Study

# Chapter 2 - Communication & Participation Channels

We have different kinds of channels to participate and communicate with each other in the community.

Since the start of the community, we wanted to let all people participate in the organization and decisions. So we need to have some way for this to make it possible.

We have two main channel groups:

## Organization Channels

### Meetup.com

We use this platform to control the Reservations to all the Meetups that we organize. It’s a great platform to manage all what we need for a great meetup organization.

You can configure next meetups, view and limit the attendees reservations, ask questions to those that make a reservation in reference that meetup, and lot more things.

It also lets us to send emails to all WordPressers in the Meetup Group, or even filter to all next attendees or other filters.

It’s your Full Meetup Group Control Panel and your best friend for this “mission”.

You can add your WordPress Meetup Group to the WordPress ["Meetup.com Chapter Program"](https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/)

### Slack

What to say about it? it gives us a great tool to create conversation between the community members.

We have channels for the Community Organization (meetups, suggestions, announces, etc.) and channels for the Community Members (questions, jobs, etc.)

We recommend to use Slack just for pure organization and make users use the WordPress.org Forums for advanced questions. This way we can have the Slack controlled just for WPBilbao organization and other Bilbao events information.

## Communication Channels

### Twitter & Facebook

We try to offer interesting information about WordPress Bilbao, WordPress Spain, WordPress, and what happens in Bilbao in Web Technologies (events, courses, etc.)

### Website

The idea of the website is to offer reviews of the meetups, WPBilbao announces and accounts and venues info.

We also want that volunteers of the community participate making blog entries and those kind of things to collaborate.

There is also a page with the [videos of the meetups](http://www.wpbilbao.es/videos/) such as www.wordpress.tv works.
